### Downloading the software

https://openrefine.org/download.html

Compatible on Windows, Mac and Linux!
The mac package comes with java built in.
The windows packages have an option of with java built in or not.
NOTE: I had my java at the most recent update via my java control panel, but the windows sans java via the github assests page sent me to the Installation documention even so. Windows package with java worked fine.

## GREL
For data manipulation, Open Refine uses GREL (General Refine Expression Language).

## External Data - using APIs

Add column by fetching URLs!!!

some guidance from https://towardsdatascience.com/dataset-manipulation-with-open-refine-a5043b7294a7

Uses the opac.sbn.it website and its API to snag ISBNs....INTERESTING. 

check with " if (condition, true expression, false expression) "

if (value.length () == 1, null, load_identification_code)

To load the identification code, you need to make the call to the API. To do this, just enter the API URL in quotes and add any variables using the + operator. In our case it is necessary to specify the ISBN, which from time to time will be equal to the value of the current line (value):

â€œhttp://opac.sbn.it/opacmobilegw/search.json?isbn=" + value
